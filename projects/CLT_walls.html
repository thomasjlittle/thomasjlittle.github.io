            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            As buildings continue to escalate in height and complexity,
            earthquakes have caused increased damage and economic hardships in
            the built environment. This, paired with an increasing desire to
            depart from life-safety based design, stresses the need for
            engineers to design seismically resilient buildings. Post-tensioned
            (PT) rocking walls are one way this can be accomplished. PT rocking
            walls allow for controlled uplift to occur during a seismic event
            which creates a rocking motion. This rocking behavior has a
            substantial impact on the behavior of the lateral system. It reduces
            the reaction forces, increases the natural period, and increases the
            lateral displacements. As a system, PT rocking walls have been
            extensively studied for both concrete and steel; however, cross
            laminated timber (CLT) is a relatively new material (especially in
            the United States) and is far less researched, demanding the need
            for further study.
            <br />
            <br />
            <img src="/images/CLTWall1.png" alt="Diagram of PT CLT Rocking Wall"
            style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-right: 3%; margin-bottom:
            0.5em; margin-top: 0.5em;"" /> CLT is an emerging structural
            material, it is composed of layers of timber glued together in an
            orthogonal configuration. This layout allows for CLT to have high
            strength, rigidity, and two-way span capacity. These traits allow
            for CLT to be a comparable structural material to steel and
            concrete. CLT has only been used in the United States since the
            early 2000s; therefore, the design code requirements are not as
            exhaustive as the requirements for concrete and steel.
            <br />
            <br />

            The system being studied in this research project is depicted in
            Figure 1. The three main components of PT rocking walls are as
            follows. (1) The CLT shear wall which allows for transfer of gravity
            and lateral forces. (2) The vertical PT cable which allows for self
            centering to occur, creating a more resilient system; however, if
            the PT cable were to yield it would result in large residual drifts
            for the system. (3) The A36 steel fuses serve to dissipate the
            energy of the system.
            <br />
            <br />

            This paper focuses on the effect of CLT toe crushing on the global
            response of the PT rocking wall system. Toe crushing is a relatively
            unique characteristic to timber walls; it is a phenomenon in which
            the extreme fibers of the wall experience crushing at low stresses.
            This research project involves the creation of a computational model
            of a PT CLT rocking wall and verification of the model using data
            from a previous research paper (Chen). The model will be used to
            study the effect of ground motions on CLT toe crushing.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Modeling Assumptions</h4>
            To facilitate this study's goal of observing the effects of toe
            crushing behavior, two models were created in SAP2000, one in which
            toe crushing was explicitly modeled and one in which it was
            neglected. Figure 2 depicts the base of the modeled CLT rocking wall
            and indicates some of the key model parameters (see the appendix for
            a full view of the SAP model). Springs (K1) were used to capture the
            effects of localized toe crushing in the CLT wall.
            <img
              src="/images/ModelDiagram.png"
              alt="Diagram analytical model"
              style="
                float: left;
                width: 40%;
                margin-right: 3%;
                margin-bottom: 0.5em;
                margin-top: 0.5em;
              "
            />
            These toe springs were modeled as bilinear plastic compression
            elements and have a post yielding increase in stiffness to account
            for the densification of the wood as it crushes. A previous research
            study provided a baseline for the toe crushing parameters used to
            model this element (Jin), however the provided values were adjusted
            within 10 percent to more closely match the model behavior with
            results from physical testing (Chen) (see the appendix for the
            spring parameters used in this SAP model). This 10 percent
            adjustment was to account for differences in wood properties in the
            CLT used by both the physical testing done by Chen and the CLT
            parameters published by Jin. Modeling the toe springs as bilinear
            elements is a very coarse assumption and led to minor inaccuracies
            in the model (further discussed in the Verification section).
            Further extrapolation beyond this simplified assumption is possible,
            however, it was a research avenue that this project chose not focus
            on due to a lack of verification data.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, at the base of the wall, gap (or contact) elements
            (G1), were used to provide compression only support. This in turn
            allows for the wall to exhibit its characteristic rocking behavior.
            These elements were only used in the middle three nodes; however,
            the model without toe crushing also used these elements at the ends
            of the wall instead of the springs used to model toe crushing. This
            allows for the model without toe crushing to rock freely without
            considering toe crushing. Furthermore, another spring element (K2)
            was used to model the fuses (or hold downs). These elements were
            located at the inner third points and serve to represent the
            buckling restrained A36 steel fuse rods that act as an energy
            dissipation mechanism for the system. These elements were modeled as
            multilinear springs which means there was a detailed backbone curve.
            SAP2000 has significantly more information on A36 steel than it does
            CLT which is why the fuses could be modeled as multilinear while the
            toe crushing elements were modeled as bilinear. Finally, the post
            tensioning cable is anchored below the base of the wall. This was
            done to ensure there is no unrealistic fixity at that middle node
            due to a pinned support. Figure 2 depicts a greatly exaggerated
            location of the post tensioning anchor location for visual purposes.
            The actual model has the anchor just below the other modeled
            elements.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Model Verification</h4>
            After the model was completed, a research paper was used to verify
            the model results. Figure 3 shows results from the model completed
            for this study on the left as well as results from the research
            paper (Chen) on the right and shows force vs. displacement curves
            under monotonic loading with differing post-tensioning forces.
            Additionally, Figure 4 shows the same results under cyclic loading
            rather than monotonic.

            A visual inspection of Figure 3 indicates a close match between this
            study's results and the results from previous, physical testing.
            Closer analysis of the two graphs show that both the pre and
            post-crushing stiffnesses are relatively well captured in this
            model, as well as the point of crushing (shown by the transition
            between the two slopes). The force and displacement at crushing
            match closely between the two graphs, however, the curvature shown
            in the physical test is not represented in the SAP model, a result
            of the bilinear nature of the CLT toe springs used. The main
            difference between the two graphs is the magnitude of displacements.
            The SAP model was calibrated using a post-tensioning force of 89 kN
            (shown as the red line) and as a result, the displacements
            corresponding to this loading condition match very closely with the
            physical testing. However, for the other two load cases (44.5 kN and
            133.5 kN), the displacements are less accurate, falling within 10
            percent of the physical test values. Furthermore, Figure 4 displays
            both the same similarities and discrepancies seen in Figure 3. It
            should be noted that the physical testing report displayed results
            in a series of three separate graphs, for ease of comparison these
            graphs were overlaid and displayed together. The hysteresis loops
            correspond to the same order of appearance as the hysteresis loops
            displayed in this study's results. Overall, these slight differences
            were likely due to the simplifications present in the CLT toe spring
            modeling assumptions. As both the pre and post-yielding stiffnesses
            are relatively similar, the differences in ultimate deflection are
            likely a result of the toe springs yielding at the incorrect point,
            although as there is no clear yield point in the physical testing,
            this is difficult to accurately diagnose.
            <br />
            <br />
            To further verify the accuracy of the model, hysteresis loops were
            plotted in Figure 5 for the SAP model with toe crushing explicitly
            modeled. Additionally, Figure 6 shows the hysteresis loop for the
            SAP model without toe crushing modeled.

            Despite not having a direct comparison, Figure 6 serves to assess
            the validity of this project's assumptions. One of the key features
            Figure 6 illustrates is the general shape of the hysteretic curve,
            with one of the major components being the distinct flag-shape that
            is commonly seen with rocking systems. Additionally, this graph
            shows an unloading response much closer to that of the physical
            test. The deflections presented by this figure, however, do not
            match the physical test, as this figure reflects a model with no toe
            crushing. By assessing these features, it was confirmed that all gap
            elements were correctly allowing the shear wall to rock, and the
            steel hold-down rods were dissipating energy as expected. Looking at
            Figure 5 a similar flag shape can be seen, however, the main
            difference is in the unloading phases. The toe-crushing model in
            Figure 5 exhibits a linear-elastic unloading phase for the majority
            of the loop which contrasts what is seen in Figure 6. One likely
            cause could be that the yield stress of the CLT used in this SAP
            model is too high, restricting it from entering its post-crushing
            behavior. Unfortunately, it was unclear what CLT properties were
            used in the physical testing so this is a likely area for
            uncertainty in this study. Overall, the general shape and deflection
            values are similar enough in Figure 5 to conclude that this model
            provides reasonable accuracy in predicting the behavior of a
            post-tensioned CLT rocking shear wall.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additional model parameters were adjusted to ensure realistic
            responses in SAP, however, the following parameters were deemed
            insignificant to the global behavior of the system. The mesh size of
            the shear wall elements (modeled as shell elements with CLT material
            properties) was reduced to 100-millimeter squares. This greatly
            increased computation time but had no significant effect on
            deflections or reaction forces. Additionally, the lateral support
            conditions of the wall were analyzed. The shear wall is laterally
            supported at each of the toes, however, under large rocking
            deformations there is a potential for this to result in unrealistic
            tensile reaction forces at each of these locations. To eliminate
            these unrealistic reactions, gap elements were used in place of
            rigid lateral restraints to provide compression-only supports. It
            was found that these lateral gap elements increased computation time
            and provided no significant changes in global response, so typical
            lateral restraints were used.

            <h4>Testing and Results</h4>
            After verifying that this SAP model was able to replicate the
            results from physical testing conducted by Chen, two
            direct-integration time history analyses were run to assess the
            performance of a CLT rocking shear wall under ground motions. The
            ground motions used in these analyses were scaled according to the
            model with toe crushing and were adjusted so that the maximum base
            shear felt by the wall was the same as its design load
            (approximately 20 kN). This was then scaled up to three times the
            design load (or about 60 kN) to evaluate performance at loads that
            were much higher than the design level. Two ground motions, Array 06
            and Lucerne, were selected from the SAP2000 time history database.
            <br />
            <br />
            After the ground motions were scaled, they were run through both SAP
            models (with and without toe crushing) to evaluate the change in
            performance due to the crushing phenomenon. The results of these
            tests can be seen in Table 1.

            The results clearly show a significant difference when toe crushing
            is accounted for. Firstly, the residual drift decreased when toe
            crushing was not accounted for; however, since it was not extremely
            large in the toe crushing model, this decrease is not a highly
            significant effect. More importantly, the maximum displacement
            significantly decreased, while the max base shear drastically
            increased. This is consistent with research surrounding rocking
            shear walls; it is often observed that the more the wall is allowed
            to rock, the lower the base shear and other support reactions are
            (Anderson). Finally, It should be noted that throughout all of these
            tests, the post-tensioned cable that provides the self-centering was
            kept to approximately 60 percent of its yield stress, so the
            residual drifts were not due to this tendon yielding.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of this research
            project. Firstly, toe crushing was found to significantly increase
            the maximum lateral wall drift. This is a realistic result when
            considering the global behavior of the system. Figure 7 shows an
            exaggerated model that infers how crushing at the toes can produce
            larger rocking effects and thus increase lateral drift.
            <br />
            <br />

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br />
            Additionally, the increased drift caused by toe crushing was also
            found to significantly decrease the reaction forces, which matches
            typical rocking frame behavior (Anderson). Finally, the residual
            drift is minorly affected by toe crushing. This is likely due to the
            two following reasons. First, the self-centering of the wall is
            controlled by the post-tensioned cable and as the cable is kept well
            within its elastic region, there is little difference in its
            behavior between the model with toe crushing and the model without.
            Secondly, this model has rigid contact elements at the center nodes
            (seen in Figure 2); therefore, even if there is significant crushing
            in the toes, the behavior of the walls will be similar when there
            are small drifts and the wall is resting on the center nodes, as was
            the case at the ends of both applied ground motions (see Figure 7).
            <br />
            <br />
            Real world applications can be drawn from these results. Based on
            this research, it is recommended that when analyzing rocking CLT
            shear walls, the effects of toe crushing should be explicitly
            modeled as it has significant impacts on the behavior of the system.
            Modeling without accounting for toe crushing will result in grossly
            underestimated drifts and overestimated reaction forces.

            <h4>Future Study</h4>
            Several research avenues have been disregarded over the course of
            this research project in the interest of maintaining a well-defined
            project scope. Some of these disregarded avenues have been noted in
            the case that further research is to be conducted. One such avenue
            is to look into further discretization of the CLT wall and add more
            crushing springs along the length of the wall rather than providing
            support at the center nodes with rigid gap elements, as is currently
            modeled. Whether or not this would be an accurate description of the
            real behavior of the wall would need to be verified, but it would
            provide continued research opportunities.
