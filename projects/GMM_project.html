            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            Earthquakes are one of the most lethal naturally occurring hazards,
            accounting for three of the top five deadliest natural disasters in
            recent history[3]. In addition to being extremely hazardous,
            earthquakes are also unpredictable, making it difficult to design
            for their effects. One method that can be used to estimate unknown
            earthquake behavior is to construct physics-based models of geologic
            hazards and estimate the impacts of different seismic scenarios.
            This method, however, is very computationally expensive and requires
            significant physical knowledge of the fault and surrounding area.
            Instead a common alternative is to use pre-constructed ground motion
            prediction equations (GMPEs) to estimate key response parameters.
            These GMPEs are attenuation relationships that take key
            characteristics of the earthquake's estimated source, path, and site
            and output parameters used for structural design and hazard
            mitigation purposes.
            <br />
            <br />
            GMPEs are generally difficult to create and require large amounts of
            knowledge about the underlying mechanics of seismic events and
            geophysical processes. As a result, there are only a handful of
            GMPEs that are widely used in practice. Generally, as you increase the
            input parameters of a GMPE, the range of scenarios and
            geographic locations that it is applicable to decreases while its
            estimated accuracy increases. Because of this, there are different
            GMPEs currently used with a wide variety of use cases that depend on
            required accuracy, generalizability and available information.
            <br />
            <br />
            The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of using
            machine learning methods to circumvent this required knowledge and
            produce new GMPEs with a model that has no prior information on
            geomechanical principles. One use case of a framework such as this
            would be to construct a GMPE specific to the available inputs of a
            given earthquake scenario to create a more accurate hazard
            prediction than using an existing GMPE with either too many or too
            few input parameters.
            <br />
            <br />
            GMPEs are often used to output a response spectrum, which is a tool
            used by structural engineers and risk analysts to evaluate the
            potential effects of a seismic event on varying building taxonomies.
            Therefore, the output of the trained model will also be a response
            spectrum. In order to quantify the accuracy of this model output,
            the response spectrum from both the GMPE and from the learned model
            will be compared to a “ground-truth” response spectrum calculated by
            running a linear response history analysis on the accelerogram that
            corresponds to a given earthquake event. Since these response
            spectra are a series of discrete paired values, the accuracy can be
            calculated using the mean absolute percent error of each series. Mean absolute
            percent error was chosen as a metric in an attempt to limit the
            over-penalization of response spectra with large ordinate
            magnitudes, as this is widely variable between seismic events.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Dataset</h4>
            The dataset chosen for this analysis was NGA-West2, a collection of
            ground motion attenuation data covering the western United States.
            This database contains over 200,000 realizations that include
            spatial and geotechnical data regarding both the seismic event, and
            the location where the ground motion was recorded, providing a
            robust description of each instance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each instance in the database also includes a response spectrum
            associated with the event at the location it was recorded, which
            will serve as the "ground-truth" for each instance. Although the
            NGA-West2 database contains ground motions collected across a
            variety of locations, it is important to note that this database is
            not comprehensive over all tectonic regimes and largely represents
            shallow crustal events. Other databases that may be explored in the
            future include GeoNet, FDSN, and K-Net, all of which contain strong
            motion data from across the globe.
            <br />
            <br />
            The primary reason these databases were excluded from this analysis
            was due to the GMPE used for performance comparison. The GMPE used
            in this analysis is the 2014 Boore, Stewart, Seyhan, and Atkinson
            (BSSA) GMPE [1], which is only valid over shallow crustal faults, so
            using it as a performance metric over all tectonic regimes would not
            be appropriate. Since the NGA-West2 database contains primarily
            shallow crustal events, it was determined that this would be a good
            initial database to use in conjunction with the BSSA GMPE as a
            metric to gauge new model performance. The few events that do not
            strictly conform to the shallow crustal regime were left in the
            dataset to serve as adversarial examples for training, in attempts
            to increase the robustness of the trained model output.
            <br />
            <br />
            One key element of the NGA-West2 database is that it contains
            recordings of the same seismic event from many different geographic
            locations, all of which may produce different response spectra.
            Because of this, the data could not be split randomly into test,
            train, and validation sets. Instead, the data was first clustered to
            ensure that all recordings of a specific event were contained within
            only one set to avoid data leakage. Once this was confirmed, the data was shuffled within
            each dataset to eliminate any sequential dependencies. The 200,000
            events were split roughly into 80% for training, 10% for validation,
            and 10% for testing.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Model</h4>
            Several model architectures were tested in attempts to reach optimal performance. These architectures included XGBoost models, 
            Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). These architectures were tested on 
            a limited dataset and evaluated based on their ability to fit the provided data as well as their robustness on unseen data. 
            From these tests it was determined that XGBoost models had the best ability to fit the response spectra
            but they were also less robust than DNNs. RNNs were considered as response spectra visually seem like continuous 
            functions, however, in these tests RNNs yielded no increase in performance over DNNs.
            From a theoretical standpoint this aligns with the computational methods used in structural engineering, 
            as each point on a response spectrum is calculated for an independent period and does not necessitate a smooth
            function. It was concluded that DNNs were the best choice for this study as they were not far behind
            the XGBoost models in ability to fit the data, and their increase in robustness made them the better choice. RNNs 
            were not selected as they did not appear to provide significant benefit over DNNs and DNNs seemed like more fun at the time.
            Also the class this project started from was a Deep Learning class so... a DNN was chosen.
            <br />
            <br />
          
            Once the model type was selected, hyperparameter tuning was carried out using the Keras Hyperband tuner
            to identify the optimal number of hidden units per layer as well as the level of
            regularization for each layer. This tuning was run for a number of different DNN model architectures
            with varying numbers of layers and regularization types (i.e. dropout, L1, and L2), 
            yielding a total of eight distinct models.
            The training and validation losses were recorded in Tensorboard for ease of
            comparison and can be seen plotted in the figure below. Note that these losses
            have been smoothed for easier visualization, the unsmoothed values for each curve 
            can be seen as a transparent layer behind each loss curve.
            <br />
            <br />

            <figure>
              <img

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br />

            From these options, the optimal model was selected and training was continued for additional
            epochs to further decreasing the validation loss. The final model consisted of an eight layer
            DNN with L2 regularization. Both the number of hidden units and the regularization constant 
            ramped up towards the middle layers and ramped back down towards the output layer. The unsmoothed
            loss curves for training and validation data can be seen in the figure below.

            <figure>
              <img

                style="margin-bottom: 0m"
              />
            </figure>

            Once the model


            Although the model appears to more closely predict the response spectra, it is still 
            unable to predict late period acceleration spikes, as can be seen in the figure below. 
            <figure>
              <img
                class="image fit"

            This is problematic because it is underpredicting the effects of seismic events on structures
            with longer periods, which typically comprise of taller structures and long-span bridges, both of
            which can cause serious issues if damages.
